/*
 * This is Unit 1 for CSCI 446, by Jeremy Kerr. It is incomplete.
 * 
 * The features that I feel I have implemented sufficiently are
 *    HTML 5 with reasonable structure - the page is organized pretty well, and only uses 2 classes to
 *        differentiate between the left and right columns for the page
 *    Variabls - I didn't use very many variables, but I used variables for constants I used multiple
 *        times and demonstrated that I understand how to use variables.
 *    Nesting - The entire sass document is essentially nested inside the body tag, and I did all of my
 *        internal elements in the same way the html document was organized.
 *    Partials - I only used one partial for the custom font.
 *    Mixins - I used one mixin to set the padding and width throughout the css document. I called it 4
 *        times. After rereading the requirements, I am not sure if I was supposed to use 2 mixins or use
 *        a mixin at least twice.
 *    Operators - I only used these once, to generate a font size variable near the top.
 *    Use a 2-column format with a full-size header/footer. Include a copyright in the footer - I created
 *        a full header and a 2 column format that was organized neatly. I did not create a footer.
 *    Login box with text fields, checkbox, button. - This does exist, and matches the example pretty much
 *        exactly.
 *    Sidebar that is slightly smaller than the login section. Includes a centered image and at least 3
 *        links - This was implemented. The background is highlighted and shows that it is smaller than
 *        the login, and has a centered picture of a cat, with text above it, and three links underneath.
 *    Uses a custom font - imported as a partial near the top and used for the headers
 *    Comments for grader for SASS features - here.
 * 
 * Features I did not implement:
 *    I did not use SASS inheritance.
 *    I did not create a footer, or add a copyright to the footer.
 *    There was no footer, so there was no sticky footer.
 *
